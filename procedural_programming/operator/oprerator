# Operator are python in given bellow

# 1. Arithmetic Operator
# 2. Assignment Operator
# 3. Relational Operator
# 4. Logical Operator
# 5. Unary Operator

# Arithmetic Operator

a = 20
b = 5

sum = a + b
sub = a - b
mul = a * b
div = a / b

print(sum, sub, mul, div)

# Assignment Operator

# multiple variables assign multiple values in one line
a, b, c = 10, 20, 30
print(a, b, c)

x = 15
print(x)

# Assignment Operator used with increment, decrement
x += 5
print(x)
x -= 5
print(x)
x *= 3
print(x)
x /= 5
print(x)

# Relational Operator
a = 5
b = 3

print(a > b)
print(a >= b)
print(a < b)
print(a <= b)
print(a == b)
print(a != b)

# Unary operator or negation

n = 7
n = -n
print(n)

# Logical operator

a = 3
b = 7

print(a < 4 and b > 5)
print(a < 4 or b > 5)

print(not False)
